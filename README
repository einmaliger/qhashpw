qhashpw is an on-the-fly secure password creation utility.

It creates secure passwords using a single master password and a set
of account data that describes the rules of each password (i.e., possible
length and allowed character classes) and what it is used for.
A simple HMAC mechanism is used to create password that are evenly
distributed over the sets of possible passwords.

The account data is stored in a single easy-to-read (JSON-like) text
file making it possible to create password in a wide variety of settings.

Implementations of the password creator exist for JavaScript and as a
ANSI-C CLI. This is my attempt at a GUI using Qt.

Right now you won't be able to make much use of it as the tool is only
able to create the password, but the account data must still be edited
in the textfile, which is not documented at this point.
